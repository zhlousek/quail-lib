Below is a list of layers that are used in QUAIL, lowest first.

# DOM Layer #

Based on the PHP DOM object collection. The DOM can come from an HTML string, URI, or file.

# CSS Layer #

Builds an indexed collection of the CSS which describes the page so we can do things like test for color luminosity.

# Test Layer #

These are generalized tests based on the [Open Accessibility Tests](http://www.atutor.ca/achecker/oac.php), the test layer is a collection of swappable tests that extend a base test class. There are some other helper classes which are built on the test class to support things like tables.

Test objects always fill reports in a general reporting object that contains either a pass/fail, or a collection of actual DOMElement objects which can be used by the reporting layer later.

# Guideline Layer #

A thin layer which associates a guideline (WCAG AAA, 508, etc), with a collection of tests.

# Reporting Layer #

Collects all the DOM objects and generates reports. These are right now just a collection of reporting objects, but will be able to generate XML, marked up pages, or HTML reports. Even more reporting can be scaffolded on these layers.

## Translation ##
The reporting layer can use multiple translations, which will be either a DB layer or PO files layer. This lets you customize the reporting errors generated by QUAIL.
